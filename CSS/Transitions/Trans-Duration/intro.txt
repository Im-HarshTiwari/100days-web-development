The transition-duration CSS property sets the length of time a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur.

/* <time> values */
transition-duration: 6s;
transition-duration: 120ms;
transition-duration: 1s, 15s;
transition-duration: 10s, 30s, 230ms;
